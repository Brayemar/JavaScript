// In Javascript we need to have an intializer before declaring a variable. In ES6 we have two main types of initiallizers i.e:

// let : It declares values which can be changed later on.

let weight = 10.5

console.log(weight)

// const : It is used to declare variables which contains values that are not intended to be changed in the entire program.
const pi = 3.142
console.log("The pi is: ", pi)
